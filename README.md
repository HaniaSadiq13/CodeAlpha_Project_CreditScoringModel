# CodeAlpha_Project_CreditScoringModel
The model predicts the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data, utilizing classification algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of the model's accuracy.
# Introduction
Credit scoring is a crucial process in the financial industry to assess the risk of lending money to individuals. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payments based on their past behavior.
The model is built using the RandomForestClassifier, a powerful ensemble learning method, and the UCI Credit Card Dataset, which is publicly available.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the UCI Credit Card Dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes 30,000 instances with 23 features related to the financial and demographic characteristics of credit card holders in Taiwan.
# Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
Accuracy:
Overall accuracy of the model.
Classification Report:
Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Confusion Matrix: 
A detailed look at how well the model performed.
Results are visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
